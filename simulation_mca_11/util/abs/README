To create an ascii file of absorption coefficients in 1/km units
run task3.pro (set itask=3 main.pro). The output ascii file
is   abscoef.dat

The task3.pro routine currently finds the first absorption coefficient
at the surface for which  absorption coefficient is greater than
datkval

Edit the zabsco.list to specify the pathnames of Vivien's hdf files 
of the o2, weak co2, and strong co2 files  

You can specify whih band to work with by iband=0,1,2 for
O2, weak CO2, and strong CO2

The alculation is done for wavel1 to wavel2 (e.g. wavel1+0.01 microns)

The broadening index (0,1,2,3   program has jbroado2=1) is set in
task3.pro and by rdabscoo2.pro2 and rdabscoco2.pro

The copy subdirectory has copies of the .pros
